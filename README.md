> This never worked well and there are much better solutions out there. I would recommend taking a look at [Konnected](https://konnected.io/collections/shop-now?filter.p.tag=Smart+Garage+Door+Openers) Garage Door Openers, which support Hubitat, Home Assistant, Control4 and other cloud based home automation platforms.
# PiGarage
This project contains the Raspberry Pi and Hubitat driver code for a Raspberry Pi hat for controlling a garage door through Hubitat. The hardware includes a relay for actuating the garage door controller, 2 door sensor inputs (open/closed), and status LEDs to communicate door status.

See the [project wiki](https://github.com/stephenpapierski/PiGarage/wiki) to get started.
